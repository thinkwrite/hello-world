# hello-world
Trying to learn code. Might start with small website project.

I have had a nagging feeling what I've worked are all to naught. I lost a job I've had for seven years, I am now two months in on unemployment. My expertise, it turns out, a dead-end job. I've nothing to show for as a call center teacher/trainer.

Fog-bound, with no compass, and adrift.

That's why I'm looking to change it up even if I am 37 years old. Hope it's not that late. I fancy myself getting into Machine Learning--started when I saw the CGP Grey video. I've to start somewhere; I need to learn code first, it seems.

Here goes nothing.
